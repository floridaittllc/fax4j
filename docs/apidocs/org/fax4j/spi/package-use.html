 This is the actual engine behind the fax4j framework.<br>
 It handles the fax client activities such as sending/suspending fax jobs and so on.<br>
 The SPI is an internal class that should be used internally only.<br>
 <br>
 The configuration of the fax4j framework is made up of 3 layers.<br>
 The configuration is based on simple properties.<br>
 Each layer overrides the lower layers by adding/changing the property values.<br>
 The first layer is the internal fax4j.properties file located in the fax4j jar.<br>
 This layer contains the preconfigured values for the fax4j framework and can be changed by updating these properties
 in the higher layers.<br>
 The second layer is the external fax4j.properties file that is located on the classpath.<br>
 This file is optional and provides the ability to override the internal configuration for the entire fax4j
 framework.<br>
 The top most layer is the optional java.util.Properties object provided by the external classes when creating a new
 fax client.<br>
 These properties enable to override the configuration of the lower 2 layers.<br>
 <br>
 For SPI specific configuration, see the relevant SPI class javadoc.</div>
